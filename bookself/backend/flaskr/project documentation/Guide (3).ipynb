    "This project is a virtual bookshelf for Udacity students. Students are able to add their books to the bookshelf, give them a rating, update the rating and search through their book lists. As a part of the Fullstack Nanodegree, it serves as a practice module for lessons from Course 2: API Development and Documentation. By completing this project, students learn and apply their skills structuring and implementing well formatted API endpoints that leverage knowledge of HTTP and API development best practices. \n",

At each stage, there will be various 'TODO's marked for you to complete. You'll also notice some TODOs in the frontend section. You should referene those sections for formatting your endpoints and responses, and update the frontend to match the endpoints you choose and the programmed behavior. \n",

    "You should feel free to expand on the project in any way you can dream up to extend your skills. For instance, you could add additional book information to each entry or create individual book views including more information about the book, your thoughts or when you completed it. "
